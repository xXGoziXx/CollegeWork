# CollegeWork
This is a collection of all the work I've done throughout my college course.

## Decrypt
#### Aim:
Given a .txt file with a certain language from the list available, this program determines which language it is.  
It does this by calculating the frequencies of characters and getting the difference between the mystery language and the list of languages.

## Hashing
####Aim:
Hashes a Dictionary file into a hashing table using various methods then allows the user to search for a word in the dictionary.

## Huffman
#### Aim:
To see the Huffman Encoding process of an ASCII sentence.
#### Example Display:
Enter your sentence: The cats did not sit on the mat

Compressed size is 107 bits / 217 bits = 49 %

## MinVolatility
This was my 2nd Year Final Project.
#### Aim:
Identify a string of natural numbers, each separated by a space, which minimizes volatility while staying below the investment amount available. 

## MonteCarloDice
#### Aim:
Say you start rolling a dice. On average you will need 6 rolls to get a 6.  
But what if, during the process of rolling for a 6,you get a Snapchat?  
Given that you received a Snapchat at some point during the rolling process, how many rolls will you need on average to get a 6?  
Now let’s make it a bit more interesting. What if you sneeze and get a Snapchatwhile you’re rolling for a 6.  
Now how many rolls will you need on average to get a 6?  
One way to answer these questions is to actually roll a dice and wait for these events to happen.  
Another quicker way is to write a Monte Carlo algorithm, which is what this program does.

## PublicKeyCrypto
#### Aim:
Extracts the message, given a public key and a cipher. (ELgamal Cryptography)

## Scrabble
#### Aim:
To be unbeatable at Scrabble by writing a computer program that uses your letters to make the longest words possible and gives you the top 10 suggestions.

## Stocks
#### Aim:
This program identifies the following using the StockData.txt file:
 1. The S&P 500 company with the lowest drawdown* between 2008 and mid-2011, the actual percentage, and the dates between which it occurred  
 2. The S&P 500 company with the highest drawdown* between 2008 and mid-2011, the actual percentage, and the dates between which it occurred  

*A drawdown is the peak-to-trough decline during a specific record period of an investment, fund or commodity.  
 A drawdown is usually quoted as the percentage between the peak and the trough.
